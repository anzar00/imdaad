## Imdaad

Mini Project - 6th Sem
- Using PHP,HTML,CSS and JS

## Problem Statement

A lot of students studying in various schools live in orphanages. These orphanages provide the basic
needs for the development and welfare of the students but once these bright minded students try to pursue higher education, they end up facing a lot of financial constraints. 

## Proposed Solution

My mini project - IMDAAD is aimed at helping such students get the required funds for their
higher education by creating a portal wherein peaple willing to help such students can come
ahead and adopt their education.

The aim of the my project thus is to help such students get required help to continue their higher
education and thus contribute to the country's workforce and make the nation great.
